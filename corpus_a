i regret that it was not possible to initiate an interinstitutional dialogue with the european parliament during the autumn .

the departure from coal in such situations can involve only one alternative - a still greater dependence on gas , which is imported from only one direction .
it regards the capacity of the eu to absorb such an enlargement , the budgetary constraints and so on , so turkey should understand how much easier - and without obstacles and frozen chapters - her accession road would be without the weight of the problem of cyprus .
the eu certainly must not fail to honour its commitment to the cause of democracy and human rights .

i regret that the question put by myself and a further 42 meps has not yet been referred to parliament in plenary because of opposition from the left .
had these powers been limited to euro zone countries alone , i would not have objected , but instead we see the commission and many members in this parliament - including ms wortmann @-@ kool , for whom i have the utmost respect - using the crisis in the euro zone as an excuse to extend the power of the eu into the economic governance of the united kingdom and other countries who do not use the euro .

i agree with the rapporteur , mrs mathieu , and with the proposal for a directive , which is part of the european union &apos;s efforts to develop a global migration policy and is a framework proposal for citizens of third countries .

it therefore remains for me to say , minister , dear cecilia , thank you very much for your cooperation and such full participation in question time during the swedish presidency .
nowadays , we see these so @-@ called modern works that are so far from the written word , from tradition .

these projects require large amounts of machinery and are highly capital @-@ intensive .
i fully endorse the author &apos;s observations and remarks about introducing and enforcing community law in the member states .
the ongoing violation of the international convention on human rights is a topic on which europe must be neither silent nor absent , least of all with regard to a country such as yemen , with which we maintain economic relations .
i told you how important it is to have a special relationship between the commission and parliament , and i will work for that .
admittedly i do see the need to include in the legal frameworks the matter of performance of external competencies in the area which includes the specific law of contractual and non @-@ contractual obligations , and also of mat@@ r@@ imon@@ ial matters .
as a result of your election by the european parliament , an additional legitimacy has been added to your function .
i also generally think , however , that we should apply ourselves with particular care to revising the trans @-@ european networks , and we should consider a point which is particularly important to me .

such a long process is odd even for the usually slow serbian judiciary , which all leads to the conclusion that c@@ eca enjoys some sort of protection in political structures , &quot; pi@@ per said .

earlier in the day , senator serb@@ an rad@@ ulescu announced he is leaving pdl &apos;s parliamentary group , thus causing the ruling coalition to lose its majority .
if we continue to look the other way - particularly now with the highly charged events happening in tunisia and the consequences for the entire region - we shall only aggrav@@ ate the security situation in the sahel and deliver another cor@@ nered , desperate generation to criminal and terrorist organisations like al @-@ qaeda in the islamic maghreb , which are already at large in the region .
no referendum may be held on this , mr leterme , and so this belgian presidency would be well advised to adopt a low profile .

there is often not much sign of this in the european parliament itself .
though miz@@ ik@@ aci@@ oglu does much of his business in turkish , his native language is arab@@ ic , which he uses to communicate with the sy@@ ri@@ ans .
in this regard , i have to say that to some extent i get the general impression that not only you , but also all of your colleagues in the council have been affected by the new institutional begin@@ nings and the uncertainty about which treaty we should actually be using as the basis for our actions , and that no one really knows where we are .

private equ@@ ities were originally regulated better .
the commission would have been required to conclude the safeguard clause procedure with findings , in order to allow the party concerned to appeal .

mr daul has even suggested that the netherlands might as well leave the european union .
dublin ii has put a burden on certain countries and it is very important that we push forward with the resettlement programme , with the help of the european refugee fund .
therefore , we should take measures at a european and not a national level and provide aid packages which are compatible throughout europe and do not distort the market , as has happened frequently in the past .
finally , i would like to thank mr lyon very sincerely for making it possible for us to work so well together .

that is my question .
&quot; moreover , it will be more than optimistic to think that &#91; chp leader kemal &#93; kilic@@ daroglu &apos;s leadership can convince his party to work with the akp on the constitution , &quot; kir@@ as says , referring to internal divisions within the chp . &quot;
last week , a new code of ethics for serbian police went into effect .

those who come normally present themselves as asylum seekers .
on 28 december , police operations were further intensified north of the divided city of mitrovica , following violent incidents in the area .

bosnia and herzegovina is the only former yugoslav republic , aside from serbia , that has not done so .

in light of the fact that certain military movements can be observed in the areas of azerbaijan occupied by armenia , in other words nagorno @-@ karabakh , my question is whether you , baroness ashton , are aware of the developments in the situation and whether you are doing anything to prevent a possible escalation , not only in this conflict , but also in the occupied territories of georgia ?
author . - mr president , thank you for allowing me to ask for clarification on two points .

in the light of that visit , i would like to ask your views on a number of issues .
(various sources 16 / 07 / 07 @-@ 23 / 07 / 07)
an eu member since may of last year , the greek cypriots are trying to use turkey &apos;s accession bid as a powerful tool for winning concessions on the un @-@ reunification plan , which their community overwhelmingly rejected in a referendum in april 2004 .
the international red cross should be allowed to visit him and his family should have every right to be informed of his situation and , of course , to visit him .
in all of these cases , it is about the direct engagement that we have and the pressure that we apply and the direc@@ tness of our approach .
&quot; the reason for such a decision is the interest observed in the previous competitions and the great number of applicants , &quot; says radio @-@ dif@@ fusion council chairman gj@@ org@@ i var@@ os@@ lija .
the majority of boats fishing in these areas are less than 15 metres , catching fish and catching quantities that have no significant impact on the fish stocks and , of course , many of them are fishing non @-@ quota species .

that could further complicate the political situation .
however , even given the best possible national healthcare systems , there will still be cases where patients will need or want help , support and medical treatment from another country .
it does you honour in your difficult circumstances .
this will not only allow a reduction in emissions of harmful substances , but may also effectively limit the dependence of the eu market on foreign supplies of energy .
imports of fishery and aquaculture products have increased enormously , but that increase has been necessary .
&quot; this is only a temporary gl@@ it@@ ch , &quot; said an un@@ named government official quoted by reuters , adding that authorities would be able to prove their credibility soon .
we will ensure follow up , since it is clear the credibility of the government and the political system rests upon a major overhaul of the electoral system .
marg@@ are@@ ta mat@@ ac@@ he@@ : cr@@ iss is a human rights organisation founded in 1993 to defend and promote roma rights .
its role will involve coordination , information exchange and actions relating to the reset@@ t@@ ling of refugees .
novi sad &apos;s petrov@@ ar@@ adin fortress is the site of what has become a major event on europe &apos;s rock and roll calendar .
i voted in favour of this report because i join the ch@@ orus of disappointment in parliament at the european union &apos;s lack of a genuinely global and uniform post @-@ lisbon approach to the common security policy .
it has been more than six years since the eu agreed to launch accession negotiations with turkey .
opportun@@ ism is most evident when gross crimes against humanity committed during the last century are neglected .

&quot; we have incredible resources -- culture , natural environment , g@@ astronom@@ y -- but no complete products .
(nl) madam president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , when i think of haiti , i think of the citizens of that country , but i also think of the european citizens who have provided an incredible amount of support to the people of haiti .
in any case , trust in my experience when i say that , in future , there must be no more periods in which the commission provides no real governance , especially when they last for as long as six months .
we urgently need reports of this kind , in which a problem is highlighted and proposals are made for initiatives to improve the quality of our health and life .
i think this is irresponsible .
this is both a belgian and a european problem .
i must stress that , as a result of the political declaration that has been adopted , nato has assumed its commitment to the territorial integrity of the republic of moldova and georgia .
some of the interested parties will likely attempt to form alliances -- perhaps even including a greek partner -- in order to mount a winning bid .
in this respect , the absolute number one priority is the preconditions for improved economic development , as without these , social unrest cannot be ruled out .
it is therefore important for us to call for a definitive system of vat rates and to clearly point out that a review of the vat directive should use the single market strategy as a guid@@ eline rather than the separate interests of the individual countries .
i would also like to welcome the speech by mr duff , who said quite clearly that the government that has been formed in the united kingdom between the conservatives and the liberal democrats is absolutely in favour of the european union signing the european union convention on human rights , and therefore of complying with the treaty of lisbon .
and thus , we will decide not on the basis of gender , but on the basis of their competence .
in addition , it should be noted that the commission &apos;s proposal does not impose any burden on pakistan in the field of human and social rights , contrary to what would have happened had gsp + status been granted to this country .
i want us to be really creative in working with people on the ground in different countries where we meet human rights defenders - and i do wherever i go .

(es) mr president , when i first entered this house 20 years ago , this debate would not have taken place , because this house was a consultative parliament at the time , and many of us have batt@@ led over the last 20 years to make it what it is today , a co @-@ legislator parliament .
by jovan dj@@ er@@ ich for southeast european times in novi sad -- 23 / 06 / 06
on behalf of the verts / ale group . - madam president , it is quite desirable to review the trading arrangements that we have with other countries and it is quite understandable that japan sees the fta as particularly attractive in relation to the recent korea fta .
we have drawn up a parliamentary resolution which forms a good basis for the discussions between the european foreign ministers .
this report , which brings together the conservative right and the social democrats , is a dangerous sympt@@ om of what we have denounced many times regarding the treaty of lis@@ bon@@ : its contribution to the deepening of neoliber@@ alism , based on the feder@@ alism and militarisation of the european union as the european pillar of nato .
i welcome your proposals , but with these you will not solve the main problem .

i should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by mrs matera .

madam president , thank you mr piebalgs for your foc@@ us@@ sed speech .

so we have taken very seriously the message that we should not be disproportionate , that we should not be putting too much burden on the different players in the trading system , and that is exactly what our report aims to do@@ : to make sure that all players in the trading system have a responsibility , that we do not put everything onto those who first put the products onto the market .
(it) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the maghreb is going through difficult times .
i fully support the statement calling on member states to sign and ratify all fundamental human rights conventions of the un and the council of europe , as well as the attached optional protocols .
is it not , by chance , true that europe has the highest levels of employee protection in the world ?
consequently , i believe that the need for a balanced media market must be supported by all member states , which must commit themselves , both individually and jointly , to providing european citizens with the opportunity of obtaining the most accurate information possible .
i would like , in particular , to draw attention to the significance that is given to the education of citizens , involving , among other things , a better understanding of the issue and respect for the protection of works involving intellectual property rights .

(fr) mr president , the more parliament boasts of the wonderful progress made on economic governance , the more i want to call on my fellow members to show some hum@@ ility , because we are te@@ et@@ ering on the edge of the ab@@ ys@@ s .
while acknowledging montenegro &apos;s right to hold a referendum , the eu has stressed the need for clear rules , leaving no room for doubt over its legitimacy or outcome .
it will benefit the country itself and the people who live there , of course , but it will also be beneficial through the creation of better opportunities for those living in the separatist regions .
there is an explan@@ ation: the cost .
we in our generation look back at ancient r@@ é@@ g@@ ime europe and we wonder how such a system could have existed .
natural disasters can and must be prevented .
therefore , the commission has also made proposals for the revision of the financial regulation aimed at clarifying the rules , ensuring their consistency with sectoral legislation and simplifying financial processes .
